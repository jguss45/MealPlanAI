# MealPlanAI
MealPlanAI is an AI powered meal planning tool for those interested in creating a customizable meal plan in seconds that will meet your needs and food preferences. 

Take into account your macros, allergies, food preferences, then simply hit submit and wait for the magic to happen. The generated meal plan will contain nutritional information for each meal as well a summary of the day. 

Whether you want to get a brand new meal plan to follow each week to keep things interesting, or you want a strong starting point that you can further tune to your preferences, MealPlanAI can make the process easier for you. 

This application was developed using the following technologies:
* React.js
* Three.js
* Valtio for state management
* Tailwind CSS
* OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo API

## Potential future changes
* This application could be further improved by swapping from the GPT-3.5-turbo API to using GPT-4. GPT-4 has much more improved performance when dealing with number based calculation and would provide more consistent accurate results.
